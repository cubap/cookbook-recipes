title: Table of contents (ranges) - acts of an opera
id: 26
layout: recipe
tags: [video, presentation, opera]
summary: "Complex nested table of contents for an opera."
---


## Use Case

An opera's table of contents can be hierarchically divided into acts, scenes, and arias.

## Implementation Notes

Implementation is similar to [Book Chapters][0024] except that nesting may be deeper.

Ranges in the structure target different portions of the same canvas using temporal [media fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#naming-time) (e.g. "t=0,100").  This is in contrast to the Book Chapters recipe where each range targets a different canvas.

## Restrictions

Overlapping ranges are avoided because they cause the overlapping part to be played twice.

## Example

The opera covers the whole length of the canvas and is divided into two ranges for the two acts.  Act I has a range for the prelude and first song and then a range for the remainder of the act.  Act II has not been subdivided into ranges for simplicity of this example.
